 Multi-Group Monte Carlo Transport Code
```

MGMC is a 3D multi-group Monte Carlo transport code which solves the Boltzmann
neutron transport equation for fixed-source, k-eigenvalue, and neutron noise
problems. 

All problem parameters such as geometry, materials, and simulation settings are
controlled through a single YAML input file. Several examples of such files are
provided in the `input_file` directory. A problem geometry may be constructed
using combinations of surface half-spaces to create cells. Like in other Monte
Carlo codes, Universes and Lattices may be used to construct more complex
geometries such as for fuel assemblies found in nuclear reactors. Material
cross sections may be provided with any number of energy groups, so long as all
materials in the problem have the same number of groups. Currently, only
isotropic scattering is supported.

Three different particle tracking methods are available to users:
surface-tracking, delta-tracking [1], and carter-tracking [2]. Either of these
may be selected in the settings portion of the input file.  When using
carter-tracking, if the majorant cross section is under-estimated, the particle
population will not be stable unless particle weight cancellation is used. A
mesh may be defined over which 3D regional cancellation is used to annihilate
positive and negative weight.

Tallies for the scalar flux and reaction rates on rectilinear mesh are
available, using a collision estimator or a track-length estimator. The tallies
are saved in `.npy` files, for easy plotting in Python. Plots of the geometry
may also be specified in the input file, and are generated when the program is
run with the `--plot` flag. Shared memory parallelism is implemented with
OpenMP, and is turned on by default.

In addition to solving standard k-eigenvalue and fixed-source problems, MGMC
is also able to solve neutron noise problems for macroscopic cross section
oscillations and for vibrations of flat surfaces. The basic methods to perform
noise transport were developed by Dr Amélie Rouchon durring her PhD [3,4].

## Install
To build MGMC, a linux system with a C++17 compliant compiler is required
(gcc >= 7 or clang >= 6 works), along with cmake >= 3.11. A few third-party
compile-time dependencies ([yaml-cpp](https://github.com/jbeder/yaml-cpp),
[docopt](http://docopt.org/), [pcg](https://www.pcg-random.org),
[ndarray](https://github.com/HunterBelanger/ndarray)) are downloaded
and compiled automatically by CMake during the build.

To build the mgmc executable, the following commands can be used:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/HunterBelanger/mgmc.git
$ cd mgmc 
$ cmake -E make_directory build
$ cd build
$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo ..
$ cmake --build .
```
This will produce an executable called `mgmc`. You can run the provided example
with the following command:
```
$ ./mgmc -i ref_sqr_c5g7.yaml
```

## Contributors
MGMC was developed by Hunter Belanger in the framework of his Ph.D. thesis
at the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA).
